Which songs have they played the most? How often do they skip them?

What time of day do they typically listen to music?

How often do they explore new artists versus replaying favorites?

Problem Statement
 The Mystery
Not every song made it to the end. Some were skipped within seconds, others played
all the way through. Some were handpicked, others auto-played by the platform.
What if we could predict which songs are destined to be skipped and which ones hit
just right?
"Can we understand and predict listener behavior—especially track
skipping—based on play context such as time of day, platform used, playback
duration, and how the track started?"
 The Mission
By exploring these patterns, we aim to predict skip behavior and uncover what keeps
listeners tuned in. This isn’t just about the songs—they’re the soundtrack. This is
about the listener, their habits, moods, and choices.
And if we can understand them, maybe we can recommend their next favorite
song—before they even know they need it.
